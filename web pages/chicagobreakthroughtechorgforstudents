The tech world needs you.
Are you interested in technology? Does programming intrigue you? Are you wondering what coding’s all about? Maybe you like to play video games, have an eye for good web design, are a social media master, or are just curious about how things work on the inside.
We have a place for you. It is Break Through Tech Chicago: led by, run by, and populated by women who want to broaden our view of what “tech” looks like. Our program is housed in the computer science department at the University of Illinois at Chicago, in the heart of the vibrant, diverse, and fast-moving third largest city in the United States.
“We need more women in technology. Most offices are male-dominant, which can be discouraging to those trying to pursue a career within this field. It’s always inspiring to see women leaders making an impact.”
Michelle Nguyen
UIC Computer Science major, Class of 2020
