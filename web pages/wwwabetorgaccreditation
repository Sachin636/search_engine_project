Setting The Standard Worldwide
We are a nonprofit, non-governmental agency that accredits programs in applied and natural science, computing, engineering and engineering technology.
ABET accreditation provides assurance that a college or university program meets the quality standards of the profession for which that program prepares graduates.
We accredit programs, not institutions. We provide specialized accreditation for post-secondary programs within degree-granting institutions already recognized by national or regional institutional accreditation agencies or national education authorities worldwide.
Our accreditation is voluntary, and to date, 4,144 programs at 812 colleges and universities in 32 countries have received ABET accreditation. Over 100,000 students graduate from ABET-accredited programs each year, and millions of graduates have received degrees from ABET-accredited programs since 1932.
ABET accreditation is ISO 9001:2015 certified, making us one of only two accrediting agencies in the U.S., and one of the few worldwide, to receive this distinction.

Accreditation Step by Step
Programs new to accreditation have a required Readiness Review 12–18 months before the on-site visit. Requests for Evaluation are due by 1/31 and Self-Study Reports 7/1, the year of the on-site visit.

Accreditation Outside the U.S.
While our accreditation process for programs outside the United States is identical to the process for programs within the U.S., there are different logistical requirements international programs should take into account.
