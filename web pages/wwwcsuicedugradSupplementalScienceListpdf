 1 Students in Human Centered Computing Concentration must take PHYS 141 & PHYS 142
  Keep in Mind:
  You must 
meet pre
-requisites
 for all courses.  Some require
 passing a placement exam (ex: 
CHEM 122 & PHYS 1
41) and s
ome require
 concurrent registration in additional courses (ex: 
PHYS 141 needs MATH 180)
.  You can take any combination of the classes above, mix and match
.   If total hours of the two classes complete
d < 10 hours
  Requirement may be fulfilled by
: 1. Taking an additional course from the list
 above
 (any 
extra hours w
ill be added to free electives)
. 2. Taking an additional course which has one of the 
above courses 
as a prerequisite (ex. EAES 200, 
EAES 230)
.   3. Taking one or more of the courses from
