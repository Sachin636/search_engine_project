Hole in the wall hotdog joint, Max's TakeOut met our quest for the perfect Chicago dog with triumph. I had the gyro, which was truly delicious, and the fries were out of this world. Highly recommended. Thanks!!
quintessential hot dog stand.
no frills.
friendly, fast and efficient.
love the chicago dog and the old school waxed soda cup vibes.
great for a quick carry out lunch or grabbing a quick bite at a counter seat.
A must next time you're in Chicago.
If you find yourself in The Loop near the Art Institute or Palmer House, Max's is a solid place to grab a dog or a polish. I often find myself taking out of towners there while showing them around downtown to get a Chicago Dog. It's fast and low key.
Think lunch counter.
The food is also good.
If you want a chance of making it out of Chicago alive just remember, NO KETCHUP!
At least 75% of murders in Chicago can be attributed to out of towners putting ketchup on hotdogs or god forbid, a Maxwell Street Polish.
Don't become a statistic.
The rundown: easy to order online and pick up, pretty good food for a decent price. Worth a trip if you want quick pick up for a good price in downtown.
First time in Chicago, staying at the Palmer, didn't want to pay the high prices for hotel room and this place was literally right next door. I ordered online since there was a coupon for new users. Ordering was easy, my husband picked up and said it was quick & easy.
Hubby tried one of their Chicago-style hot dogs and the Italian beef, I had the gyro. Pretty darn good! The gyro had tons of meat on it and was tasty. The tzatziki tasted mayo-based instead of Greek yogurt-based, but decent for take out. Hubby said his was pretty good, too.
Overall, give it a try if you want good Chicago-style food at the right price point off the Magnificent Mile, especially if you're staying at the Palmer. I think their website says they deliver, so you could probably get delivery for much cheaper than hotel room service!
I love love Max's Take Out! I work on Adams right next door to this place and never got a chance to try it until very recent. I came here for a take-out order after work one day, and the guy behind the counter greeted me with a huge smile on his face the minute I walked in. He asked if this was my first time here and gave me a few recommendations. I was so happy to find out that anything on the menu can also be made halal. I prefer halal meat (besides religion) just because it is healthier more hygienic, and less cruel than non-halal.
For the takeout order I decided to go for the gyro cheeseburger with a side of cheese fries. Service was fast and the food tasted absolutely delicious. I'm not a big hotdog fan, so I don't know if I can recommend this place as the best hotdog in Chicago, but it seemed extremely popular among the other customers. After that, I've mostly ordered Max's Take Out for delivery through Grubhub and their service has always been consistent. Delivery has always been fast, arrives earlier or on time and the food delivered has always been delicious.
Till next time!
I finally gave this place a try for lunch. I like that it's available on Ritual. I got a beef and cheese fries. The beef was nothing special. I prefer cheese fries with cheese on the side, but the cheese was of a good consistency that I didn't mind it was spread all over the fries.
Delicious, small (~150SF) local takeout spot for Chicago-style hotdogs.
This is as legit as it gets!! White onions, sport peppers, neon-green relish, Vienna dog, yellow mustard, pickle and poppy seed bun.
Having grown up in Chicago and worked on Randolph, I can't believe I never stopped in to Max's until I visited here last weekend.
The Italian beef was good too though I didn't love the roll.
And I wished it was stuffed with a few more shreds of that tasty beef.
The GF and I were lucky to find seats here and saw a steady stream of locals with their usual orders.
Thank you YELP for helping me find this spot.
Definitely a tasty, local spot with some history and somewhere I would recommend for locals and visitors alike.
My first time having a Chicago style hot dog and Italian beef sandwich and enjoyed every bite, thanks to Max's. I did not know a life where ketchup does not belong on a hot dog, or where hot dog buns could be poppyseed, or that relish could be such a radioactive green color. My bf randomly found this hole-in-the-wall place after a much needed lunch break from a 3 hour trip at the Art Institute of Chicago museum, which is about a 5-10 min walk from Max's.
I personally liked the hot dog more than the Italian beef just because it was so novel to me. The hot dog/sandwich is no more than approximately 6 inches in length which is perfect because it'll fill you up but will still leave ya hungry for that next Chicago bite. I would def recommend this not only to people visiting Chicago but also to the locals!
Max's Take Out is a straight hole-in-the-wall no-frills cheap-priced downtown-located joint to grab a Chicago bite. Walk in, grab a hot dog with everything on it, devour it somewhere, and you'll have had a Chicago hot dog experience. What do you expect though for a placed called Max's Take Out? It may not be the best hot dog ever, but it's one that scream Chicago with the mustard, pickles, tomatoes, onions, sport peppers, and celery salt, all for about $4. If I lived in the area, I'd be a regular here for sure!
Max's is my new favorite place to get a Chicago hot dog or Italian beef when I'm in the city. We discovered Max's on the way to a whirlwind trip to Chicago when my spouse won the #ham4ham lottery and we scored $10 tickets to see at Hamilton. Our schedule didn't allow for a fancy pre-theater dinner, but that was just fine.
Max's has all of the takeout classics, served hot and fresh. Most people take their food to go, but we ate at the counter. This place is just a few blocks from the CIBC Theater. Prices are reasonable. Service is friendly and truly Chicagoan. If you're in the mood for a working man's pre theater snack, I highly recommend Max's. We ordered champagne at the theater before the show as Max's does not serve alcohol.
It is one of only a few old school takeout counters left. When I eat here, I'm transported to my childhood--visiting family in the big city, hearing that Chicago accent and the commentary on orders. I try to never leave the Windy City without getting a hot dog (I've been known to order one at the train station for breakfast at 8 am). Max's is my new favorite way to get the fix.
Max's is a little tucked away on a side street, but don't let that deter you!
This place, although doesn't look have the fancy looks the food is really good. I had a grilled chicken gyro take out once and it really tasted good. It's the basic ingredients put together with nice flavor.
Place is quiet small to dine in, well its known as take out is one cannot expect to have a fancy dining experience. It has few seats on the side. I ordered my food through Ritual and I didn't have to wait long in the line. I will definitely go back.
So good I came here twice in my 4 days in Toronto. This is a genuine hall-in-wall cranking out great Chicago specialties:
-My first Chicago hot dog (I tried the classic dog and Polish, both loaded, and they were outstanding). "Sports peppers" are take them or leave them, based on your spice tolerance.
-Italian beef sandwich -- this was my first. Soggy, dipped into gravy, it's like eating a rolled up a wet sock of beef (in the best possible way).
-Wife had the Chicago burger -- really solid, all with the same embellishments as the weiner.
-Beef tamale: color me converted. For $2, it was a satisfying injection of cornmeal carbs when I was starving.
-Cheese fries did the job.
Pro tip: order online, save time and money.
So me and my friends just got to downtown Chicago and was dying for a hot dog. We went to this one place and waited for a while and it was underground and didn't have the right "feel" to what we were looking for. We went on google maps and found this place was close and had good reviews. I walked in and right away was like yes! This is the place I want my first chIcago dog at! We ordered some dogs and fries and everything turned out so good! Service was great too!
So many locals recommended Max's and we walked almost 40 blocks to try it (mainly because we got lost and started walking in circles). Be prepared to take your food with you! We got lucky and got there before the crowd and had a nice place to sit.
This place a just okay. I guess I was expecting the best of the best because it was highly recommended by the locals and had so many amazing yelp reviews. Here's what we got:
Double cheeseburger: patties are super thin. Nothing great......but a good greasy burger when u r drunk. Much smaller than what I thought it would be and too much mustard for my taste.
Fries: just regular fries. Not even sure there was salt on them. We were given 2 ketchup packets. Not enough.
Jumbo Dog with everything: so.....when I see jumbo dog on ten menu, I imagine something about the size of a Costco dog. Unless the dogs are super skinny, I think I had a regular old Chicago dog. It was very neat and it was good, but not great. I hate to say it, but it tasted just like the ones from weinerschnitzel ..... the fast food joint in California and they are half the price.
Polish sausage with everything: ok, so ordering this was our fault. On the menu it is listed under hot dogs, and it clearly says that "everything" is mustard, peppers, pickle, relish, onion and celery salt. But the picture of it had grilled onions and mustard......this is what we expected to get. Honestly, the polish sausage tasted just like a hot dog.
The bread on everything was great super soft and fresh.if I happen to be in the area, and there is no long line and a place to sit, I might perhaps give it another shot. But I certainly won't go out of my way to dine here again.
NO FREE REFILLS ON SODA BY THE WAY.
Your classic Chicago style hotdog, all the necessary trimmings. Good taste and fast service. Excellent fries! Thicker cut, perfectly golden, crispy on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside.
Wonderful place for hot dogs. Got a hot dog with everything on it and loved every bite -- and I'm usually not a fan of getting everything with a hot dog. Definitely recommend!
Not much seating if you are looking for a place to chill, but definitely a great place for a great hot dog.
My first ever authentic Chicago style hot dog. Max's did not disappoint! Great little place. Nothing but dogs, sausages, burgers, and fries. Perfect. And the dog was great, especially the "sports peppers".
In the interest of trying some other items:
Gyro cheeseburger is quite good, but honestly, if I were blindfolded, I don't think I would have tasted the lamb; too many other sauces going on, even without the sauce they offer on the side.
The Italian beef sandwich is outrageously good.
I'm gonna give this place a solid 3.
If your new to the beef sandwich game you might be inclined to give it a higher score.
Me, well, I have been around and I've tried a few in my day.
Although the beef sandwich was acceptable, it was nothing to write home about.
The size was a little small and the flavor was a bit bland.
I ordered a hot and a mild and the peppers were terrible on both. They had no visual appeal.
They were simply jalapeño peppers sliced and placed on top-not what I'd expect.
In short, if your hungry it will do the job.
If your looking for the real Chicago hot or mild wet beef sandwich this might not be your best stop.
Tiny hot dog joint in the loop. Never seen it too busy but always a healthy cycle of people coming in and out. They have hot dogs, burgers, polish sausages, kebabs, fries and many other similar options in the same food groups.
Staff has always been polite and prompt. Food comes out very quickly, well packaged and wrapped in case it needs to travel. Hot dog sizes are a little small, but come with generous amounts of all the fixings on a bun that never comes soggy. Polish sausages come with the ends split for max crispiness. The bread is a little too fluffy for my taste but overall the dogs are a really solid package.
