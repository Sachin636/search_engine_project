Our students need you.
UIC seeks to connect with companies large and small that are interested in providing students with either traditional internships or innovative Break Through Tech internship experiences. Working together, we will open doors for women by giving them the résumé credentials they need to turn the dream of a technology career into a reality.
We are now developing a slate of student internship and employee volunteer opportunities for the 2020-2021 school year. If you are an employer in the Chicago area, have a local technology function of any kind, and want to help tech to become more diverse and inclusive than it is today, we encourage you to join us. Please fill out the form below, and we will be in touch.
